This module adds analytic account and lets users register payslip lines manually.

* In the payslip, there is a new section "Manual payslip lines".
* In the contract, there is a new tab "Recurring payslip lines".
* "Compute Sheet" will create payslip lines from the manual/recurring lines.

This way, a payroll user may register the exact values of a payslip line:

* Salary rule
* Analytic account
* Quantity
* Rate
* Amount

Multiple lines may use the same salary rule, with different analytic accounts.
This is useful when e.g. the monthly wage should be split into multiple analytic accounts.
